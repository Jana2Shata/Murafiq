Question: Is it permissible for my father to
perform ‘Umrah with money borrowed from the
bank?
Answer: It is obligatory for one who intends to
perform Hajj or ‘Umrah, whether for himself or on
behalf of someone else, to select a pure expenditure
from lawful earnings for his Hajj and ‘Umrah, for
Allah Almighty is Good and accepts only what is
good.
Borrowing from the bank or others with interest
is not permissible, as it constitutes Riba (usury).
The Prophet (ﷺ) cursed the one who consumes
usury, the one who pays it, its scribe, and its
witnesses, saying: “They are all equal.” Consuming
unlawful earnings is a reason for rejecting
supplications and non-acceptance of deeds.
However, if it is without interest, then there is no

harm.

Question: Is it true that someone absent from
Makkah for forty days must perform ‘Umrah, even
if he has performed ‘Umrah several times before?
Answer: ‘Umrah (minor pilgrimage) is
obligatory only once in a lifetime for those who are
accountable and capable. Any additional
performance beyond the first is considered Sunnah.
‘Umrah is permissible at any time and is not
restricted to a specific period.

Question: Is it permissible to perform ‘Umrah at
any time of the year?
Answer: It is permissible to perform ‘Umrah at
any time of the year, even during the months of Hajj.
If one performs it during the months of Hajj and
then performs Hajj in the same year, he is
considered to be performing Tamattu‘, combining
‘Umrah with Hajj. If he performs it along with his
Hajj, he is performing Qirān, combining Hajj and
‘Umrah. Both the performers of Tamattu‘ and Qirān
are required to offer a Hady (sacrificial animal) that

suffices as an ’Ud'hiyah, unless they are residents of
the Sacred Mosque. If the pilgrim performs it in
Dhul-Hijjah after the days of Tashrīq, it is
permissible, and no offering is required.

Question: What is the ruling on performing

Question: Some people come for Hajj, and after
completing the ‘Umrah of Tamattu‘, they wish to
perform ‘Umrah on behalf of one of their parents.
How should they proceed?
Answer: Whoever assumes Ihrām for ‘Umrah as
part of Tamattu‘ (combining ‘Umrah and Hajj), it is
best for him, after completing it, to remain in
Makkah until the time for Hajj becomes due, then
assume Ihrām for it and not repeat ‘Umrah before
Hajj. After completing Hajj, there is no harm in
performing another ‘Umrah from Tan‘īm or other
places outside the sacred precincts. If he performs
another ‘Umrah on behalf of his deceased father or
mother, or for those unable due to old age or illness
with no hope of recovery, or others in similar
circumstances, there is no objection—due to the
general saying of the Prophet (ﷺ):
» «
“‘Umrah expiates for the sins committed
between it and the next ‘Umrah, and the accepted
Hajj has no reward but Paradise.” Its authenticity is

Question: What is the ruling on performing more
than one ‘Umrah, and for each ‘Umrah, going to
Tan‘īm to assume Ihrām from there?
Answer: Performing multiple ‘Umrahs for
someone who comes to Makkah in a short period
was not part of the guidance of the Prophet (ﷺ), nor
was it practiced by his Companions (may Allah be
pleased with them). Had it been the best practice,
they would have preceded us in doing it. What is
prescribed for someone who comes to Makkah and
completes his rites is to engage abundantly in
Tawāf (circumambulation of the Ka‘bah),
especially, as well as reciting the Qur’an, prayer,
charity, and other acts of worship. If he performs
‘Umrah for himself or on behalf of another for
whom it is permissible to perform ‘Umrah, such as
the deceased or someone unable due to old age or
illness with no hope of recovery, there is no harm in
doing so provided it does not cause hardship to him
or to others, such as times of crowding—as
indicated by the statement of the Prophet (ﷺ):
» «
“‘Umrah expiates for the sins committed
between it and the next ‘Umrah, and the accepted
Hajj has no reward but Paradise.” And it is
authentically reported that the Prophet (ﷺ)
commanded ‘Ā’ishah (may Allah be pleased with
her) to perform ‘Umrah from Tan‘īm after she had

completed her Hajj and ‘Umrah, when she sought
permission for that.

Question: If someone intends to perform Hajj or
‘Umrah, and it is difficult for him to assume Ihrām
on the plane, and he also does not know the location
of the Mīqāt, is it permissible for him to delay the
Ihrām until Jeddah or not?
Answer: If one intends to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah
while on the plane, he may take a bath at home and
put on the Izār and Ridā’ (lower and upper
garment) if he wishes. When he reaches near the
Miqāt, he should assume Ihrām for either Hajj or
‘Umrah, as he wishes, and this does not entail any
hardship. If he does not know the location of the
Miqāt, he should inquire from the pilot, one of the
assistants, a flight attendant, or a fellow passenger

Question: Is it permissible for someone
intending to perform ‘Umrah while traveling by

plane to make Talbiyah for ‘Umrah only without
wearing the Ihrām, as he wishes to conduct some
business in Jeddah first, and after completing his
work, assume Ihrām from Jeddah and proceed to
perform ‘Umrah, or what is required of him?
Answer: Whoever embarks on a journey
intending to perform a rite of Hajj or ‘Umrah, it is
not permissible for him to pass the Mīqāt except in
a state of Ihrām with the intention he has made,
divested of stitched clothing, and avoiding the
prohibited acts of Ihrām.
Therefore, it is not permissible for you to do
what you mentioned in the aforementioned
question, as it contradicts the Shariah ruling.
However, there is no objection to going to Jeddah
without assuming Ihrām to fulfill his needs and
then returning to the Mīqāt to assume Ihrām for his
Hajj or ‘Umrah.

Question: Is it valid for a pilgrim performing Hajj
or ‘Umrah to assume Ihrām from Abyār ‘Alī in
Madīnah, given that they landed at Jeddah Airport
but are proceeding to Madīnah first and then
assuming Ihrām from Abyār ‘Alī?
Answer: If a pilgrim lands at Jeddah Airport
intending to go from Jeddah to Madīnah before

performing Hajj, then after completing his visit to
Madīnah and wishing to return to Makkah to
perform Hajj or ‘Umrah, he must assume Ihrām
from the Mīqāt of the people of Madīnah, Dhul-
Hulayfah, also known as Abyār ‘Ali, because his
ruling is the same as that of the people of Madīnah,
as the Prophet (ﷺ) said regarding the Mīqāts:

them who are not of their people, intending to

Question: If a person performs ‘Umrah on a
Friday of any month and then wishes to travel to
another area, then returns to Makkah after two or
three days and intends to perform a second ‘Umrah,
is it permissible to perform ‘Umrah without
wearing Ihrām clothes?
Answer: If a person intends to perform ‘Umrah,
he must assume Ihrām from the Mīqāt he passes by
on his way to Makkah, and it is impermissible for
him to bypass it without assuming Ihrām. This is
because the Prophet (ﷺ) specified these Mīqāts for
assuming Ihrām for those intending Hajj or ‘Umrah,

whether it is for the first time or a subsequent
‘Umrah. As for those within the Mīqāts, they should
assume Ihrām from the place where they make the
intention for ‘Umrah, unless they are in Makkah, in
which case they must go beyond the sanctuary to
assume Ihrām for ‘Umrah, as ‘Ā’ishah (may Allah be
pleased with her) did following the command of the
Prophet (ﷺ).

Question: What is the ruling for someone who
performs ‘Umrah on behalf of his father after

yourself and ended your Ihrām, and then wish to
perform ‘Umrah on behalf of your father, if he is
deceased or unable, you should go to the area
outside the Sacred Precincts, such as Tan‘īm, and

Question: If someone puts on Ihrām for ‘Umrah
or Hajj and then dissolves it, what is due upon him?
Answer: If one wears the Izār and Ridā’ without
intending to enter into Hajj or ‘Umrah, and does not
assume Ihrām, he has the choice: If he wishes, he
may enter into Hajj or ‘Umrah, and if he wishes, he
may refrain from doing so, and there is no blame
upon him if he has already performed the
obligatory Hajj and ‘Umrah of Islam.
If he has intended to enter into Hajj or ‘Umrah,
he is not permitted to annul it and withdraw from
it. Rather, he must complete what he has entered
into the state of Ihrām for, in the prescribed
manner, based on the statement of Allah Almighty:
﴾... ﴿

{And complete Hajj and ‘Umrah for Allah.}
[Surat al-Baqarah: 196]
Thus, it becomes clear to you: If a Muslim enters
into Hajj or ‘Umrah with the intention, he is not
permitted to abandon it; rather, he must complete
what he has commenced, as per the noble verse
mentioned, unless he has made a condition and the
hindrance he feared occurs, in which case he may
exit Ihrām. This is based on the statement of the
Prophet (ﷺ) to Dubā‘ah bint az-Zubayr when she
said: “O Messenger of Allah, I intend to perform Hajj
while I am ill.” He said:
1
. » «
“Perform the Hajj and stipulate, saying: I will
end my Ihrām at the place where You restrain me.”

Question: A woman assumed Ihrām for ‘Umrah,
then she had her menses and did not perform
Tawāf or Sa‘i, and she returned to her home and
ended her Ihrām. Is anything due upon her? And if
she did not end her Ihrām, is anything due upon
her?
Answer: If a woman assumes Ihrām for ‘Umrah
and then menstruates, thus ending her Ihrām
before performing Tawāf and Sa‘i, and if she was
unaware of the ruling and her husband did not have
intercourse with her, she must complete her
‘Umrah after her menses ceases and she performs
Ghusl (ritual bath) as she would for Janābah (major
ritual impurity). She should then perform Tawāf
and Sa‘i and end her Ihrām by shortening her hair,
and there is nothing due upon her.
If intercourse occurs, her ‘Umrah is invalidated,
and she must complete it with Tawāf, Sa‘i, and
shortening of the hair, and she must make up for it
by performing another ‘Umrah from the Mīqāt
1
where she assumed Ihrām for the first one. She
must offer a sacrificial animal, either a sheep that is
six months old or older, or a goat that is one year
old or older, to be slaughtered in Makkah and
distributed among its poor.
If she has not yet exited the state of Ihrām from
her ‘Umrah, she must complete her ‘Umrah by
performing Tawāf and Sa‘i, and then exit the state
of Ihrām by shortening some of her hair. Her
‘Umrah is not invalidated by menstruation in any
case.

Question: Is it permissible for someone in the

perfume, including the use of perfumed soap. If one
intentionally and knowingly applies perfume, then
expiation is required. However, if one is unaware of
the ruling or forgets, then there is nothing upon
him, as indicated by the words of Allah Almighty:

forget or fall into error.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 286]

forgetfulness, he must desist from it as soon as he
remembers. There is no sin upon him, nor is any
expiation required, as Allah Almighty says:

Question: My wife and I assumed Ihrām for

her menses. Due to my ignorance of the ruling, I
exited the state of Ihrām and removed the Ihrām
clothing, and we did not proceed to Makkah. Then,
by the grace of Allah, my wife and I performed
‘Umrah this Ramadan. Kindly clarify the legal ruling
and what I should do now.
Answer: You were obligated to perform the
‘Umrah and not annul it. Since your rejection of the
intention of Ihrām and wearing regular clothes
does not change the reality, as the Ihrām remains
unbroken, your second ‘Umrah is considered a
1
continuation of your first ‘Umrah. If you engaged in
marital relations during this period before
performing the ‘Umrah, you must perform another
‘Umrah as compensation for the one invalidated by
the marital relations, starting from the Mīqāt where
you assumed Ihrām for the first ‘Umrah. You are

each of you, to be slaughtered in Makkah and

Answer: Accidentally touching the perfume on
the Ka‘bah and then proceeding to anoint your
body, hair, and clothes with the perfume, which is
prohibited for you, necessitates an expiation. This
expiation is fasting for three days, feeding six needy

Question: Is the Iḍṭibā‘ (uncovering the right arm

upon someone who forgot to perform Iḍṭibā‘? Is
kissing the Black Stone sufficient without saying:
Bismillāh wa Allāhu Akbar (In the Name of Allah
and Allah is the Greatest)? What is due upon
someone who omitted this saying and sufficed with
kissing the Stone out of forgetfulness, and then
remembered after moving away from the Stone,
and said it while heading towards the Maqām (the
Station of Abraham)?
Answer: Idtibā‘ is for the male pilgrim to place
the middle of his robe under his right armpit and its
ends on his left shoulder, thereby exposing his right
shoulder and arm. It is a Sunnah act during the first
Tawāf upon arrival in Makkah, whether it is the
Tawāf of ‘Umrah for those performing Tamattu‘, or

Qirān or Ifrād. If one omits it, there is nothing upon
him.
There is no blame upon one who omits the
Takbīr (proclamation of Allah's greatness) and
Tasmiyah (mention of Allah's name) at the
beginning of Tawāf, for the Takbīr, Dhikr, and
supplication during Tawāf and Sa‘i are all Sunnah

Answer: Kissing the Black Stone during Tawāf is
a confirmed Sunnah of Tawāf, if it can be done
without crowding or harming anyone by your
action, following the example of the Messenger of

by crowding and causing harm, then it is obligatory
to refrain and suffice with pointing to it with the
hand, especially for women, as they are considered
‘Awrah (i.e. should not be exposed), and because
crowding is not legislated for men, so it is even
more so for women. Furthermore, it is not
permissible for her, even if she can kiss it without
crowding, to uncover her face while kissing the
Black Stone, due to the presence of non-Mahram

Question: Regarding brisk walking between the
two green signs during Sa‘i for women, I have not
found in my limited readings of the books of Fiqh in
the chapter of Hajj and ‘Umrah anything that
prohibits women from brisk walking. I once heard
from a scholar on television that women should not
briskly walk during Sa‘i, and that it is only for men,
as it is more protective for women and prevents
them from exposing their charms during brisk
walking. However, he did not provide any evidence
for this statement. I thought to myself: If this is truly
his opinion based on his own reasoning, then brisk
walking is also a Sunnah that began with Hajar
(may Allah be pleased with her). But, praise be to
Allah, I understand the opinion, and praise be to
Allah that religion is not based on opinion, as the
Commander of the Faithful ‘Ali (may Allah be

Answer: Ibn al-Mundhir said: “The scholars
unanimously agree that women are not required to
walk briskly around the Ka‘bah or between Safa
and Marwah, nor are they required to uncover their
right shoulder. This is because the original purpose
of these acts is to display strength, which is not
intended for women; rather, women are meant to
be covered, and walking briskly and uncovering the
shoulder could lead to exposure.”

Question: If someone shaved his head during
‘Umrah this week and then intends to perform
another ‘Umrah the following week, what should he
do, considering his hair is very short and might not
have grown back yet?
Answer: If one performs ‘Umrah or Hajj, he must
shave his head or shorten his hair. However, if there
is no hair on the head, this obligation is waived, and
his Hajj or ‘Umrah remains valid.

Question: I went with a group to perform
‘Umrah, and they completed their rituals, with one
of them shaving for the others, then one of them
shaved for him, and they ended their Ihrām in this

Answer: If a Muhrim shaves the head of another
Muhrim who intends to exit the state of Ihrām,
there is no harm in that, as it is a permitted shaving.

Question: Is it correct to shave in Hajj and
‘Umrah with a razor or with a machine? And is
shaving with a razor better than shaving with a
machine, or are they both the same?
Answer: The essence of the matter is the
completion of shaving or shortening the hair using
any tool, with the understanding that shaving is
preferable. Shaving involves the removal of hair
with a blade or similar tool. It is authentically
reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) invoked forgiveness
and mercy three times for those who shave their
heads and once for those who shorten their hair.

Question: If a resident of Jeddah performs
‘Umrah and does not shave his head until he returns
to Jeddah, what is the ruling on this action?
Answer: There is no harm in shaving the head for
the rites of Hajj or ‘Umrah, whether inside or
outside the Sacred Precincts. However, in ‘Umrah,
one does not exit the state of Ihrām until he shaves
or shortens his hair. In Hajj, after he has thrown the
Jamrah (stones) and performed Tawāf and Sa‘i, he
must not have marital relations with his wife until
he shaves or shortens his hair.

Question: A person came to Jeddah, and the next
day went to perform his first ‘Umrah in his life. He
went with a close relative and completed the
‘Umrah. After finishing Sa‘i, I asked him: Should we
shave or shorten our hair? He said: We will shave at
home. After we returned home, we forgot to shave
and removed our Ihrām clothes. What is due upon
us, may Allah reward you?
Answer: If someone forgets to shave or shorten
his hair, performs Tawāf and Sa‘i, and then wears
his regular clothes before shaving or shortening, he
must promptly remove his clothes once he
remembers, wear the Ihrām clothing, then shave or
shorten his hair, and thereafter he may wear his
regular clothes. There is nothing due upon him in
this matter, nor is there any sin upon him, as he is
excused due to forgetfulness.

Question: My father performed Hajj once on foot
approximately 40 years ago, and he performed
‘Umrah twice, one of which was at least three years
before his death. He was a man who could neither
read or write, and I do not know how he performed
this Hajj. Is it obligatory for me to perform Hajj on

Answer: Hajj is obligatory only once in a lifetime,
and the fundamental principle in performing acts

required a second time. However, if you perform
Hajj on behalf of your father, it becomes a voluntary

Question: Is it permissible for a married woman
to perform Hajj without her husband's consent if
she is accompanied by her relatives, who are her
brothers?
Answer: It is not permissible for a woman to
travel for Hajj without her husband's permission
unless it is the obligatory Hajj, as her husband does
not have the right to prevent her from performing
it if she has a Mahram. It is not permissible for her
to travel without a Mahram, neither for Hajj nor for
any other purpose, based on the saying of the
Prophet (ﷺ):
. » «
“It is not lawful for a woman who believes in
Allah and the Last Day to travel except in the
3
company of a Mahram.” The group of women is not
sufficient in place of a Mahram, and this applies
equally to the obligatory Hajj and other types of
Hajj.

Question: If I wish for my young child, who has
not reached puberty, to perform Hajj with me,
should I dress him in Ihrām clothing and perform
all the rituals on his behalf, such as making Tawāf
for him, etc., or should I dress him in his regular
clothes and not perform anything on his behalf
since he is young and Hajj is not obligatory for him?
Answer: If a discerning child who has not
reached puberty wishes to perform Hajj, his
guardian should instruct him to wear the Ihrām
clothing and perform all the Hajj rituals himself,
starting from assuming Ihrām at the Mīqāt to the
completion of the Hajj rites. The guardian may
throw the pebbles on his behalf if the child is unable
to do so himself and should instruct him to avoid
the prohibited acts of Ihrām. If the child is not
discerning, the guardian should intend Ihrām for
him, whether for ‘Umrah or Hajj, and perform
Tawāf and Sa‘i with him, bringing him along for the
rest of the rituals and throwing the pebbles on his
behalf.

Question: She came to the Kingdom and was
facilitated to perform the obligatory Hajj at the
expense of the host. She asks if this Hajj suffices for

Answer: Her performance of the obligatory Hajj
is not affected by the fact that she did not spend any
of her own money on it, or that she spent very little

Answer: It is permissible to perform Hajj by

However, it is not permissible for someone to
perform Hajj once and dedicate it to two people, as
Hajj is only valid for one person, and the same

Question: What is the ruling for someone who
traveled for Hajj and intended his ‘Umrah for his
3
mother and his Hajj for his father, and in the
following year, he reverses it by performing Hajj for
his mother and ‘Umrah for his father? Is this
permissible or not?
Answer: Each of Hajj and ‘Umrah is an
independent ritual. The Prophet (ﷺ) explained how
to perform them in the forms of Qirān, Ifrād, and
Tamattu‘. Thus, if someone wishes to assume Ihrām
for ‘Umrah on behalf of his mother, for instance, and
then assume Ihrām for Hajj after completing
‘Umrah on behalf of his father, or vice versa, he may
do so. If he assumes Ihrām for one of the rituals on
his own behalf, and after completing it, assumes

Answer: If a Muslim dies without having

5
If someone else, who is eligible to perform Hajj and

Question: Why has Allah prohibited pilgrims
from wearing stitched clothes, and what is the
wisdom behind this?
Answer: Firstly, Allah ordained Hajj upon those
who are capable among the accountable
individuals, once in a lifetime, and made it a pillar
of Islam, as it is known by necessity in the religion.
Thus, a Muslim must fulfill what Allah has ordained
upon him, seeking Allah's pleasure and complying
with His command, hoping for His reward and
fearing His punishment, with the confidence that
Allah Almighty is Wise in His legislation and all His
actions, Merciful to His servants, and He legislates
only what is in their best interest and brings them
immense benefit in this world and the Hereafter. To
our Lord, the Wise Sovereign, belongs the
legislation, and upon the servant is compliance with
5
submission.
Secondly: The rationale behind the prescription
of wearing unstitched garments during Hajj and
‘Umrah includes numerous wisdoms, such as:
reminding oneself of the conditions of people on
the Day of Resurrection, as they will be resurrected
barefoot and naked before being clothed, and in
remembering the conditions of the Hereafter lies
admonition and reflection. It also includes
subduing the soul, instilling the necessity of
humility, and purifying it from the filth of
arrogance. Furthermore, it signifies the principles
of closeness, equality, and asceticism, distancing
from detestable luxury, and showing solidarity with
the poor and needy, among other objectives of Hajj
in the manner prescribed by Allah and elucidated
by His Messenger (ﷺ).

Question: Why does the pilgrim wear those
clothes during the Hajj?
Answer: Allah has commanded us through His
Messenger Muhammad (ﷺ) to wear the Izār and
Ridā’ (lower and upper garments) during Hajj and
‘Umrah for a wisdom known to Him. Thus, it is
obligatory upon us to comply, hoping for reward,
whether we understand the wisdom or not. Among
5
what scholars have mentioned regarding this is the
reminder of the state of people on the Day of
Gathering and Resurrection, and to feel humility,
and establish equality between the rich and the
poor in the pilgrimage. We ask Allah for success,
guidance, and steadfastness upon the truth until we
meet Him.

Question: What is the ruling concerning the Hajj
of a menstruating woman?
Answer: Menstruation does not prevent one
from performing Hajj. A woman who assumes
Ihrām while menstruating must perform the rituals
of Hajj, except that she cannot perform Tawāf
around the Ka‘bah until her menstruation ceases
and she makes Ghusl. The same applies to a woman
in her postpartum period. If she performs the
pillars of Hajj, her Hajj is valid.

the Kingdom and then had her menses before

Answer: She should remain in her state of Ihrām
and perform all the rituals that the pilgrims do,

the Ka‘bah until she becomes pure from menses,
her menstrual blood ceases, and she takes a bath.

Question: Is it permissible for a man, when he
assumes Ihrām at the Mīqāt, to sit and clip his nails,
or is it impermissible for him to do so until after he
has slaughtered the Ud'hiyah (sacrificial animal)?
Answer: If this is done before assuming Ihrām,
there is no harm unless one intends to offer an
Ud'hiyah and the month of Dhul-Hijjah has
commenced, in which case it is not permissible, as
the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade it. However, if
this is done after assuming Ihrām, meaning after
the intention to enter the state of Ihrām, it is
absolutely impermissible, as the Muhrim is not
allowed to clip his nails or take anything from his
hair, except after completing his Tawāf and Sa‘i for
‘Umrah, at which point he exits his Ihrām by
shaving or shortening his hair. Similarly, in Hajj,
after throwing the pebbles at Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, it
is prescribed for him to shave or shorten his hair,
with shaving being preferable. He then exits his
5
Ihrām, whether this is before or after the
slaughtering, although doing so after the
slaughtering is preferable if feasible.

Question: My father performed Hajj in a previous
year while he was severely ill and was unable to
enter into Ihrām; what is due upon him?
Answer: If a pilgrim enters Ihrām while wearing
sewn clothes due to necessity, such as cold or
illness, he is permitted to do so according to
Shariah. However, he is required to either fast for
three days, feed six needy people—each receiving
half a Sā‘ of the local staple food—or slaughter a
sheep that suffices as a sacrifice. The same ruling
applies if he covers his head. Fasting is permissible
anywhere, but feeding the needy and slaughtering
the sheep must be done in the Sacred Precincts of
Makkah.

Question: I wish to perform Hajj, Allah willing,
and my problem is that I am a bald man with no hair
covering my head, and my skin is very sensitive.
Any sunlight affects my health, causing severe
5
inflammation of the scalp and the appearance of
veins on the head in particular and the face in
general. As you know, one of the prohibited acts of
Ihrām is covering the head. I kindly request your
esteemed guidance regarding this situation,
knowing that I am a short-statured man and cannot
carry an umbrella as it would harm those around
me. May Allah protect you and guide your steps.
Answer: If the situation is as mentioned, then
you cover your head while in Ihrām, and you must
offer a ransom by slaughtering a sheep to feed the
poor in Makkah, or feed six needy people in the
Sacred Precincts, giving each needy person half a
Sā‘ of dates or other staple food, or fast three days.
This applies to Ihrām for Hajj, and similarly, if you
entered Ihrām for ‘Umrah, another ransom is due
upon you.

Question: A pilgrim engaged in a prohibited act
by kissing his wife and ejaculating with desire
without intercourse after casting the Jamrah of
Aqabah and shaving, but before performing the
Tawāf al-Ifādah (pouring forth), while she is not a
pilgrim. Please provide us with a ruling. May you be
rewarded.
Answer: It is not permissible for a Muslim who
5
has assumed Ihrām for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or both, to
engage in acts that invalidate his Ihrām or diminish
his acts of worship. Kissing is prohibited for one
who is in the state of Ihrām for Hajj until he
completes the full exit from Ihrām, which is
achieved by throwing Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, shaving or
shortening the hair, performing Tawāf al-Ifādah,
and Sa‘i if it is required of him; because he remains
under the rulings of Ihrām, which prohibits
intimacy with women. The Hajj of one who kisses
his wife and ejaculates after the first exit from
Ihrām is not invalidated. He must seek forgiveness
from Allah and should not repeat it. He must also
compensate for this by slaughtering a sheep that
suffices for Ud'hiyah and distributing it among the
poor of the Sacred Precincts of Makkah. It is
obligatory to hasten to do this as much as possible.

Question: I performed the obligatory Hajj, and
one night while I was in Mina, I had a wet dream
and was unable to perform Ghusl. Is there anything
due upon me?
Answer: Experiencing a wet dream while in the
state of Ihrām for Hajj or ‘Umrah does not affect the
validity of one's Hajj or ‘Umrah, and they are not
invalidated. If this occurs, the person should
5
perform Ghusl from Janābah (sexual impurity)
upon waking if he sees any discharge. There is no
ransom due upon you, as the wet dream is beyond
your control.

Question: Is there any special status for the
pigeons of Makkah and Madīnah?
Answer: There is no special distinction for the
pigeons of Makkah or the pigeons of Madīnah,
except that hunting and disturbing them are not
allowed within the boundaries of the Sacred
Precincts, due to the general Hadīth:
، ،

، «

.» ، ، ،


“Allah has made Makkah a sanctuary, and it was
not lawful (to fight in it) for anyone before me, nor
will it be lawful for anyone after me. It was made
lawful for me only for an hour of a day. It is not
allowed to uproot its shrubs, cut its trees, or disturb
its game.” [Narrated by Al-Bukhāri] The Prophet
(ﷺ) also said:
، ، «

. » ،
“Indeed, Abraham (Ibrāhīm) declared Makkah
6
as sacred, and I declare Madīnah as sacred between
its two lava tracts. Its thorny trees are not to be cut,

Question: Is it permissible to take off the Ihrām
clothing after performing ‘Umrah, knowing that I
am a pilgrim of Tamattu‘ Hajj?
Answer: It is prescribed for a pilgrim performing
Tamattu‘ Hajj to end the state of Ihrām after
completing ‘Umrah, which includes Tawāf, Sa‘i, and
shaving or cutting the hair, and then to wear his
ordinary clothes, as the Prophet (ﷺ) instructed his
Companions who did not bring sacrificial animals
during the Farewell Hajj. Then, he assumes Ihrām
for Hajj on the 
Tawāf, Sa‘i, and shaving or shortening his hair, has
ended his ‘Umrah and is permitted what was
prohibited during Ihrām, such as shaving, clipping
nails, wearing stitched clothing, covering the head,
using perfume, hunting wild animals, contracting
marriage, and engaging in sexual intercourse and
its preliminaries.

compensate for them? May Allah reward you with
goodness.
6
Answer: If a woman intending to perform Hajj
begins her menses, she should assume Ihrām and
remain in her Ihrām, performing all the rituals of
Hajj such as standing at ‘Arafāt, staying overnight in
Muzdalifah and Mina, and throwing the pebbles.
However, she should not perform Tawāf around the

bath.

Question: I performed Hajj, and after assuming
Ihrām at the Mīqāt as a performer of Ifrād, I said:
“Labbayka Allāhumma Labbayka Hajj” (I respond to

Question: I observed some pilgrims cutting
branches from trees to make tooth-sticks and using
them. What is the ruling on cutting trees in Mina,

trees of the Sacred Precincts, neither for a Muhrim
nor for others, as the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

.» ، «
“It is not allowed to strike its thorns or cut its
trees.” [Narrated by Muslim]
6
Whoever does any of that must repent to Allah

Question: I made some families perform Hajj
who rented my car for the pilgrimage. On the night
of Muzdalifah (departure from ‘Arafah), we left
‘Arafah at 9:00 PM and reached Muzdalifah at 2:0AM. They insisted on not staying overnight in
Muzdalifah, claiming that they had families with
them and that the Shariah permitted this. We did
not stay in Muzdalifah for more than a quarter of an
hour. Is there anything due upon me for this?
Answer: If their condition was as you mentioned,
that they had families with them whom they feared
for staying until dawn, then there is no blame upon
you or them if your departure from Muzdalifah was
at the second hour of the night according to the
meridian time; for that was after midnight, and the

Question: Due to the severe crowds during last
6
year's Hajj, some pilgrims were unable to stay
overnight in Muzdalifah because of the difficulty in

they do?
Answer: Whoever is unable to stay overnight in
Muzdalifah due to the crowds, is excused from the
obligation of staying overnight. However, if one
loses his way and spends the night elsewhere, he is
required to offer a sacrifice, as he could have
inquired about Muzdalifah and found his way to it;

Question: A questioner who performed Hajj of
the Sacred House asks: He departed from

Answer: Whoever departs from Muzdalifah
before midnight without a valid excuse, such as
illness, has not fulfilled the obligation of staying
overnight there. He must offer a ransom by
slaughtering a sheep in Makkah, which suffices as a
sacrifice, and distribute it among the poor there;

second or third day of the days of Tashrīq without
a valid excuse, as the Prophet (ﷺ) threw it on the
Day of Eid, and the Companions followed him in
this, not delaying it to the days of Tashrīq without
an excuse. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

“Take your rituals from me.” If one delays it until
the days of Tashrīq without a valid excuse, he has

Question: Is it obligatory to shave the head or
shorten the hair in the greater termination of Ihrām
after having shaved or shortened the hair in the
minor termination, i.e., after completing stoning the

Answer: It is neither obligatory nor
recommended to shave the head or shorten the hair
after the major termination of Ihrām, once one has
already shaved or shortened the hair during the
minor termination, that is, after completing the
stoning of the Jamarāt. This is because it is a rite of
Hajj and thus an act of worship, and acts of worship
7

authentically reported from the Prophet (ﷺ) that he
shaved or shortened his hair after the major
termination; rather, he did so only at the time of the

Question: I performed the rites of ‘Umrah and
after completing them, I returned to my hometown.
Since I intend, Allah willing, to perform the
obligatory Hajj this year, is a ransom due on me or
not? May Allah reward you with goodness.
Answer: The majority of jurists hold that you are
not required to offer a sacrificial animal because
you did not combine ‘Umrah with Hajj in one
journey. You mentioned that after performing
‘Umrah in Shawwāl of the year 1395 AH, you
returned to your home country and did not remain
in Makkah to perform Hajj.
Some jurists hold the view that you are required
to slaughter a sacrificial animal if you perform Hajj
in the same year, even if you return to your country
or to a place farther than that, due to the general
7
saying of Allah Almighty:
﴾... ...﴿

{then if anyone takes a break between ‘Umrah
and Hajj, he must offer a sacrifice of whatever
animal is available.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 196] The
ruling and practice are in accordance with the
opinion of the majority of scholars: that the
sacrifice is not obligatory in this matter.

Question: What is the ruling for someone who
forgot to shorten their hair after completing the
rituals of Hajj and did not remember until a long
time had passed?
Answer: Shaving the head or shortening the hair
is an obligatory ritual in Hajj and ‘Umrah. If one
forgets to perform it, he must shave or shorten his
hair once he remembers. If intercourse occurs
before shaving or shortening, a ransom for the
intercourse is required, which is a sheep that
suffices for sacrifice, to be slaughtered in Makkah
and distributed among the poor of the Sacred
Precincts. This is because in Hajj the second ending
Ihrām is not completed, and intercourse before it
necessitates a ransom. Similarly, in ‘Umrah, the
Ihrām is not fully ended.

its designated days, as the obligation is to throw
them one by one. Throwing them all at once is akin
to throwing a single pebble. If he does not repeat
the throwing, a sacrifice is due upon him for leaving
out an obligation of Hajj. The sacrifice is a sheep
that suffices as an offering, to be slaughtered in

Question: My maternal aunt performed Hajj last
year, but when she was throwing the Jamrahs, she
said that due to the intense crowding, she could not
see where the pebbles fell, whether they fell into
the basin or not. However, she did see the Jamrah at
times while throwing. What is due upon her? Please
provide us with a Fatwa, may you be rewarded.
Answer: Among the conditions for the validity of
pebble-throwing is the certainty that the pebbles
fall into the basin. If she is certain at the time of
throwing that they fell into the basin and then
doubts afterward, the doubt has no effect, and her
throwing is valid. However, if she is doubtful and

Question: Some pilgrims—may Allah guide
them—throw everything they find at the Jamrahs,
8
from shoes to empty water bottles and other items.
Is their throwing invalidated due to such actions, or
are they excused due to their ignorance?
Answer: It is not permissible to throw shoes or
bottles and the like at the Jamrahs, as this is not
legislated and it contradicts the guidance of the
Prophet (ﷺ), for he threw the pebbles with small
stones slightly larger than chickpeas, and he said:

. » «
“Take your rituals from me.” They are sinful for
their actions, and whoever sees them should forbid
them and advise them. Their act of throwing is not
invalidated if they throw the prescribed pebbles.

Question: Are women experiencing
menstruation or postpartum bleeding, as well as
those who are incapacitated or ill, required to
perform the Farewell Tawāf?
Answer: A woman in menstruation or
postpartum is not required to perform the Farewell
Tawāf. As for the one who is unable, he should be
carried for Tawāf, and likewise the sick person, as
the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

“No one among you should depart until the last
thing he does is (Tawāf around) the House.” It is
narrated by Al-Bukhāri and Muslim that Ibn ‘Abbās
(may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said:
“People were commanded to make Tawāf around
the Ka‘bah the last thing they do, but an exception
was made for the menstruating woman.” Another
8
Hadīth indicates that a woman in the postpartum
period, like a menstruating woman, is not required
to make the Farewell Tawāf.

Question: During the Farewell Tawāf, I fell ill and
stopped my Tawāf, while the rest of my
companions completed theirs. After they finished, I
went with one of them to complete the remainder
of my Tawāf. I forgot one round of the Farewell
Tawāf and only realized that after returning to my
country. Is there any expiation or anything due
upon me?
Answer: If you are certain that you missed a
round of the Farewell Tawāf, you must observe the
ransom, which is to slaughter a sheep in Makkah
that suffices as a sacrifice and distribute it among
the poor of the Sacred Precincts. If unable to offer
the ransom, then fast for ten days.

Question: I performed Hajj, and on the second
day of Tashrīq, I performed the Farewell Tawāf
after ‘Asr, but I spent the night in Makkah and did
not travel to Tā’if until the following morning.
8
Please advise me whether the Farewell Tawāf that
my family and I performed is sufficient, or if an
expiation is due, or if we need to repeat the Tawāf.
Please advise, may Allah reward you.
Answer: If one performs the Farewell Tawāf for
Hajj and then remains in Makkah for a short period
after the Tawāf, there is no need to repeat it.
However, if the stay after the Tawāf is prolonged, it
becomes obligatory to repeat the Tawāf. Since you
performed the Farewell Tawāf after ‘Asr and did
not travel until the following morning, and you
departed without repeating the Tawāf, each of you
is required to offer a sacrifice that suffices as an
Ud'hiyah, to be slaughtered in Makkah and
distributed among the poor of the Sacred Precincts.
However, if there was a woman among you who
was menstruating or in the postpartum period, she
is not required to perform the Farewell Tawāf.

Question: My wife performed Hajj last year, and
her Hajj was Tamattu‘. She completed all the rituals
of Hajj except for the Farewell Tawāf, as she began
her menstrual period. Consequently, she did not
perform the Farewell Tawāf. My father took her to
the Sacred Mosque, and she viewed the Ka‘bah.
What is the ruling on this matter? Please provide
8
me with guidance, may Allah Almighty reward you.
Answer: The Farewell Tawāf is exempted for a
menstruating woman, and there is nothing due
upon your wife, as it is authentically reported that
Ibn ‘Abbās (may Allah be pleased with him and his
father) said: “People were commanded to make
Tawāf around the Ka‘bah the last thing they do, but
an exception was made for the menstruating
woman.” And ‘Ā’ishah (may Allah be pleased with
her) reported:
: ، «
، : »؟ « : ،
. » « : ، ،
Safiyyah bint Huyayy had her menses after she
had performed Tawāf al-Ifādah. She mentioned this
to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he said: “Is she
going to prevent us from departing?” I said: “O
Messenger of Allah, she has performed Tawāf al-
Ifādah and circumambulated the House, and then
she had her menses after the Ifādah.” He said: “Then
let her depart.”

Question: If someone enters Makkah without
performing ‘Umrah or Hajj and wishes to leave, is
the Farewell Tawāf obligatory upon him? And is the
8
Farewell Tawāf required for one who performs
‘Umrah if he stays in Makkah for a day or two or
similar? Is there a specific Tawāf called the
Farewell Tawāf that is reported from the Prophet
(ﷺ), or can any Tawāf suffice as the Farewell Tawāf
if one departs Makkah thereafter? Please provide
us with a Fatwa, may Allah reward you and not
deprive you of Paradise—amen.
Answer: The Farewell Tawāf is only obligatory
upon the pilgrim when intending to travel from
Makkah after Hajj, according to the Hadīth of Ibn
‘Abbās (may Allah be pleased with him and his
father), who said: “People were commanded to
make Tawāf around the Ka‘bah the last thing they
do, but an exception was made for the menstruating
woman.” Its authenticity is agreed upon. The same
ruling applies to women in the postpartum period.
As for those who are not performing Hajj, they are
not required to perform the Farewell Tawāf
according to the correct opinion, because the
Prophet (ﷺ) did not command it for those
performing ‘Umrah. The Farewell Tawāf for Hajj
must be performed with intention, as it is an act of
worship and a deed, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said:
. » ، «
“Verily, deeds are judged according to
intentions, and everyone will only have what he
intended.” And Allah knows best.

Question: Is it permissible to purchase some
necessities after the Farewell Tawāf, and is
anything due upon someone who buys after the
Tawāf?
Answer: It is obligatory for the Farewell Tawāf
to be the last act a pilgrim performs in his Hajj, and
he should depart from Makkah thereafter.
However, there is nothing wrong if he stays for a
short period to wait for his companions, load his
belongings, or purchase some necessities.

Question: A pilgrim performed the Farewell
Tawāf on the twelfth day, then went to Mina and
threw the Jamrahs. Is his Tawāf valid since he
performed it before the throwing? What is required
of this man, who is from Jeddah?
Answer: If one performs the Farewell Tawāf
before throwing the pebbles, it does not suffice;
because the Farewell Tawāf must be the last of the
Hajj rituals. If he travels before redoing the
Farewell Tawāf after the throwing, he must
slaughter a sacrificial animal in Makkah and
9
distribute it among the poor of the Sacred Precincts,
and he should not consume anything of it. Only
what suffices for Ud'hiyah is acceptable. If he is
unable to do so, he must fast for ten days.

Question: Zamzam water is described as having
numerous properties. Is there an authentic Hadīth
regarding this matter?
Answer: Zamzam water is the noblest water on
earth, and the most authentic report regarding its
merit is found in Sahīh Muslim Collection, where
the Prophet (ﷺ) said about Zamzam:

. » ، «
“It is blessed, and it is food that satisfies.” Abu
Dāwūd added with an authentic Isnād:

» «
“And a cure for ailments.” The Prophet (ﷺ) is
also reported to have said:

“Zamzam water is for whatever it is drunk for.”

Question: If I intend to perform ‘Umrah during
Ramadan, Allah willing, and visit the City of the
Messenger (ﷺ), what do you advise me?
Answer: It is legislated to undertake a journey to
visit the Prophet's Mosque, but not for visiting the
grave of the Prophet (ﷺ) or any other grave, as the
Prophet (ﷺ) said:
، ، : «
. »
“A journey should not be made except to three
mosques: the Sacred Mosque, this mosque of mine,
and Al-Aqsa Mosque.” However, it is legislated for
one who visits the Prophet’s Mosque to greet the
Prophet (ﷺ) and his two Companions, Abu Bakr and
‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). It is also
legislated for him to visit the graves of Al-Baqī‘ and
the martyrs, supplicate for them, ask Allah’s mercy
upon them, and remember death and what follows
it. Additionally, it is legislated for him to visit the
Qubā’ Mosque to pray therein, as there are Hadīths
reported regarding this.

Question: Is it obligatory for pilgrims, both men
and women, to visit the grave of the Prophet (ﷺ), Al-
Baqī’, ’Uhud, and Qubā’, or is it only for men?
9
Answer: It is not obligatory for pilgrims—men or
women—to visit the grave of the Prophet (ﷺ) or Al-
Baqī‘. Indeed, it is prohibited to undertake a
journey for the purpose of visiting graves in
general, and it is forbidden for women, even
without undertaking a journey; as the Prophet (ﷺ)
said:
، ، : «
. »
“A journey should not be made except to three
mosques: this mosque of mine, the Sacred Mosque,
and Al-Aqsa Mosque.” [Agreed upon] And he (ﷺ)
cursed women who visit the graves. It suffices for
women to pray in the Prophet’s Mosque and
frequently invoke Allah's peace and blessings upon
the Messenger (ﷺ) in the mosque and elsewhere.
